# Validator Testing

1. The webiste CSS files pass through the [Jigsaw validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) with no issues found.
![csslivepage](https://res.cloudinary.com/kolle1993/image/upload/v1672221870/P5%20Readme/cssvalidatelive_epgb0q.png)

## CSS workspace:

2. The following issues were raised on the css source code, and have been intentionally ignored as they are in relation to code that was provided in the Moments Walkthrough project and cant be located in the project:

![cssresults](https://res.cloudinary.com/kolle1993/image/upload/v1672225040/P5%20Readme/cssvalitaor_frvojq.png)

## JS testing Eslint:

 3. Manually tested all javascript files in [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and resulted all with the same error:
 - Parsing error: 'import' and 'export' may appear only with 'sourceType: module'

## LightHouse:

 4. Performance 71, after some research on how to improve this i noticed that the photo quality is very high and that was causing a lower performance score on desktop.

 ![Desktop](https://res.cloudinary.com/kolle1993/image/upload/v1672225608/P5%20Readme/lighthouse_desktop_rne6gg.png) 

 5. On mobile devices the performance is also lower due to rendering speed, a future fix for both desktop and mobile will be added.

 # Debugging

1. Unfollow function was not working due to a 405 delete corserror:
  ![unfollowError](https://res.cloudinary.com/kolle1993/image/upload/v1672225987/P5%20Readme/unfollow_error_u5xxij.png).

The error was caused by the delete function being called on the wrong view in my url pattern's
The error was fixed by changing the called view from:path "views.FollowerList.as_view())" to: views.FollowerDetail.as_view()).


2. Frontend 401 token error in consol.
Was fixed by installing jwt decoder and adding a fuction to refresh tokens in the utilis file.

3. Duplicated profile icon's on the navbar were on was not clickable:
![Dubbleprofile](https://res.cloudinary.com/kolle1993/image/upload/v1672226205/P5%20Readme/nav_debug_hcuk1c.png)

 - This was fixed by removing a stray Avatar code line in my Navbar.js component.


 4. Console logged error that the rendering was running in strict mode.
The error was caused by my index.js was set <React.StrictMode><App />, 

- The solution was removing <React.StrictMode> from the App.

5. Comment's were not showing in the comment field.

- The error was some comments intendation error and syntax error in cloudinary that has been resolved.
